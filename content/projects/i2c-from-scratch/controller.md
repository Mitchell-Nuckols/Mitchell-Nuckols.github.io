## Setting up the controller firmware in C

Okay I was going to do this in Zig first, but honestly I should probably be focusing my efforts on C for now, since that's what I'm more likely to have to use in industry. This is, after all, a project for expanding my "marketable" skills.

I'll update this page when I get something good going on the controller side
