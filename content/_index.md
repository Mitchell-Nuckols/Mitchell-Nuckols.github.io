I'm Mitchell! I have a Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of California, San Diego. I'm currently working as a Project Engineer with a focus on embedded data acquisition and control systems.

I have a laundry list of interests, which I add to almost daily. Here are a few off the top of my head:
* Embedded systems
* Industrial automation and control
* Cellular and neurobiology
* Microfluidics
* Analog audio/video synthesis
* STEAM outreach and education
* Hardware hacking
* Language learning, specifically Japanese
* And much more...

If any of these things interest you and you want to have a chat, feel free to reach out!
