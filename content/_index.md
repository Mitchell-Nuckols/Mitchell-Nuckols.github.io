## Who am I?
I'm an electrical engineering student focusing on embedded systems. My professional experience lies primarily in web development, but my long-term goal is to pivot to prototype development.

I have a wide variety of interests. Here are a few off the top of my head:
* Neurobiology
* Agricultural engineering
* Analog audio/video synthesis
* STEAM outreach and education
* Hardware hacking
* Language learning, specifically Japanese
* And many more...

One of my favorite aspects of learning something new is exploring how it might intersect with engineering and technology.

If any of these things interest you and you want to have a chat, feel free to reach out!
